This is my HTNE submission

# Summary
People always say that they want to take the time to get in shape but they're too lazy to buy a gym membership, equipment, go on youtube for workouts, change their diet and so on. This is because they have to do lots of work, typing query's in the google search bar. That's bad. With my exercise startup plan, you have access to workouts, diets, advice, and gyms nearby. We must understand that each person is unique. You may or may not be a body builder, you may or may not be someone who hasn't worked out in decades and has trouble standing up from the couch, that's fine. Your experience on this program will be based on you and your goals only.
